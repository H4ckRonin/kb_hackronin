## Learning Objectives
- Accurately assess a web application based on methodological, industry-standard best practices
- Identify and prioritize testing objectives based on business impact and risk assessment

## Introduction to Web App Security Testing

### Web Application
- Understanding web applications
- Client-server architecture
- HTTP/HTTPS protocols
- Web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc.)

### Web App Architecture
- Three-tier architecture
- MVC (Model-View-Controller)
- RESTful APIs
- Microservices architecture
- Single Page Applications (SPA)

### HTTP/HTTPS
- HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.)
- HTTP headers
- Status codes
- HTTPS/TLS
- Cookies and sessions

## Web App Pentesting Methodology

### Testing Phases
1. **Reconnaissance**
   - Information gathering
   - Passive and active reconnaissance
   - Technology identification

2. **Mapping**
   - Application mapping
   - Functionality identification
   - Entry point discovery

3. **Vulnerability Discovery**
   - Manual testing
   - Automated scanning
   - Code review (if available)

4. **Exploitation**
   - Proof of concept
   - Impact assessment
   - Risk evaluation

5. **Reporting**
   - Documentation
   - Risk rating
   - Remediation recommendations

### Testing Standards
- OWASP Testing Guide
- PTES (Penetration Testing Execution Standard)
- NIST Cybersecurity Framework
- OWASP Top 10

### Risk Assessment
- CVSS scoring
- Business impact analysis
- Likelihood assessment
- Risk prioritization

## Tools
- Burp Suite
- OWASP ZAP
- Nmap
- Nikto
- Wireshark
