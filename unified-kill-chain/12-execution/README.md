# Phase 12: Execution

## Overview
Execution involves running commands and code on compromised systems. This phase focuses on executing malicious code, scripts, and commands to achieve objectives.

## Objectives
- Execute commands on compromised systems
- Run scripts and payloads
- Execute code in various contexts
- Bypass execution restrictions
- Maintain execution capabilities

## Common Techniques

### Command and Scripting Interpreter
- Command prompt execution
- PowerShell execution
- Bash/Shell execution
- Python execution
- Other scripting languages

### Scheduled Task/Job
- Windows Task Scheduler
- Linux cron jobs
- Systemd timers
- At jobs

### Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI)
- WMI for execution
- Remote WMI execution
- WMI event subscriptions

### PowerShell
- PowerShell execution
- PowerShell remoting
- PowerShell scripts
- Encoded PowerShell

### Service Execution
- Service creation
- Service modification
- Service execution

## Tools
- Metasploit
- Cobalt Strike
- PowerShell
- Custom scripts

## Defensive Measures
- Application whitelisting
- Script blocking
- PowerShell logging
- Process monitoring
- Behavioral analysis

## Related Phases
