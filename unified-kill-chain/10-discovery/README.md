# Phase 10: Discovery

## Overview
Discovery involves learning about the environment, systems, users, and resources after gaining access. This phase helps attackers understand what they can access and what their objectives should be.

## Objectives
- Map the network
- Identify high-value targets
- Understand user permissions
- Discover sensitive data locations
- Identify security controls

## Techniques

### Network Service Scanning
- Port scanning
- Service enumeration
- Network mapping

### System Network Configuration Discovery
- Network interfaces
- Routing tables
- DNS servers

### System Owner/User Discovery
- Current user
- Logged-in users
- User groups

### Account Discovery
- Local accounts
- Domain accounts
- Service accounts

### Permission Groups Discovery
- Local groups
- Domain groups
- Privileged groups

### Cloud Service Discovery
- AWS services
- Azure services
- GCP services

## Tools
- BloodHound
- PowerView
- LinPEAS
- WinPEAS
- ADExplorer

## Defensive Measures
- Monitor enumeration activities
- Limit user permissions
- Network segmentation
- Log monitoring
