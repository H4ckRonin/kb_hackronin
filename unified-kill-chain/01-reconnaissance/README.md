# Phase 1: Reconnaissance

## Overview
Reconnaissance is the first phase of the Unified Kill Chain, involving the gathering of information about the target before launching an attack. This phase is critical for understanding the attack surface and identifying potential entry points.

## Objectives
- Identify target infrastructure
- Discover attack surface
- Gather intelligence about technologies
- Map network topology
- Identify potential vulnerabilities
- Collect employee information

## Techniques

### Passive Reconnaissance
Gathering information without directly interacting with the target.

### Active Reconnaissance
Directly interacting with target systems to gather information.

### OSINT
Open Source Intelligence gathering from publicly available sources.

### Subdomain Enumeration
Discovering subdomains associated with the target domain.

### Port Scanning
Identifying open ports and services on target systems.

### Service Enumeration
Determining versions and configurations of running services.

## Tools
- Nmap
- Masscan

## Defensive Measures
- Monitor for reconnaissance activities
- Limit information disclosure
- Use rate limiting
- Monitor DNS queries
- Implement honeypots
