# Phase 3: Delivery

## Overview
Delivery involves transporting weaponized payloads to the target environment. This phase focuses on getting malicious code to the target through various channels.

## Objectives
- Deliver payloads to targets
- Use multiple delivery channels
- Evade detection during delivery
- Ensure payload execution
- Maintain operational security

## Common Delivery Methods

### Email Delivery
- Malicious attachments
- Phishing links
- Embedded macros
- Social engineering

### Web Delivery
- Malicious websites
- Compromised websites
- Watering holes
- Drive-by downloads

### USB Delivery
- USB drops
- Malicious USB devices
- Autorun exploitation
- Physical access

### Network Delivery
- Network shares
- SMB delivery
- FTP delivery
- Remote file execution

### Supply Chain Compromise
- Compromised software updates
- Third-party libraries
- Software repositories
- Build processes

### Drive-by Compromise
- Compromised websites
- Malicious advertisements
- Browser exploits
- Plugin vulnerabilities
