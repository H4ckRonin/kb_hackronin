# Phase 2: Resource Development

## Overview
Resource Development involves preparatory activities aimed at setting up the infrastructure required for the attack. This phase focuses on establishing the necessary resources, tools, and infrastructure before launching the attack.

## Objectives
- Set up attack infrastructure
- Acquire or develop tools
- Establish accounts and services
- Prepare payloads and exploits
- Configure C2 infrastructure
- Obtain capabilities

## Common Activities

### Infrastructure Setup
- Domain registration
- Server provisioning
- Cloud infrastructure
- VPN setup
- Proxy services

### Tool Acquisition
- Acquiring existing tools
- Developing custom tools
- Modifying existing tools
- Testing tools

### Account Setup
- Creating accounts
- Compromising accounts
- Establishing personas
- Social media accounts

### Capability Development
- Exploit development
- Payload creation
- Backdoor development
- Obfuscation techniques

## Tools
- Cloud services (AWS, Azure, GCP)
- Domain registrars
- VPN providers
- Development tools
- Testing environments

## Defensive Measures
- Monitor for infrastructure setup
- Track domain registrations
- Monitor cloud service usage
- Threat intelligence
- Attribution analysis
