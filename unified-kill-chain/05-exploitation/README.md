# Phase 5: Exploitation

## Overview
Exploitation is the phase where attackers take advantage of vulnerabilities to gain initial access to systems or escalate privileges. This phase is critical for establishing a foothold in the target environment.

## Objectives
- Gain initial access to target systems
- Exploit identified vulnerabilities
- Escalate privileges
- Establish foothold
- Bypass security controls

## Techniques

### Initial Access Exploitation
- Exploiting public-facing applications
- Compromising external remote services
- Using valid accounts

### Web Application Exploitation
- SQL Injection
- XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)
- Command Injection
- File Upload Vulnerabilities
- Authentication Bypass

### Buffer Overflows
- Stack-based buffer overflows
- Heap-based buffer overflows
- SEH overflows

### Privilege Escalation
- Windows privilege escalation
- Linux privilege escalation
- Active Directory privilege escalation

## Tools
- Metasploit Framework
- Custom exploits
- Burp Suite
- SQLMap
- WinPEAS
- LinPEAS

## Defensive Measures
- Patch management
- Vulnerability scanning
- Application security testing
- Least privilege principle
- Network segmentation
